/**
 * A concurrent data structure that exposes a linear sequence of `R` resources as a single
 * [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] in `F` without accumulation.
 *
 * A [[Hotswap2]] is allocated within a [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] that dictates the scope
 * of its lifetime. After creation, a `Resource[F, R]` can be swapped in by calling [[swap]].
 * The newly acquired resource is returned and is released either when the [[Hotswap2]] is
 * finalized or upon the next call to [[swap]], whichever occurs first.
 *
 * The following diagram illustrates the linear allocation and release of three resources `r1`,
 * `r2`, and `r3` cycled through [[Hotswap2]]:
 *
 * {{{
 * create(r1) ----- swap(r2) ---- swap(r3) ---- X
 * |                |             |             |
 * r1 acquired      |             |             |
 *                  r2 acquired   |             |
 *                  r1 released   r3 acquired   |
 *                                r2 released   |
 *                                              r3 released
 * }}}
 *
 * [[Hotswap2]] is particularly useful when working with effects that cycle through resources,
 * like writing bytes to files or rotating files every N bytes or M seconds. Without
 * [[Hotswap2]], such effects leak resources: on each file rotation, a file handle or some
 * internal resource handle accumulates. With [[Hotswap2]], the only registered resource is the
 * [[Hotswap2]] itself, and each file is swapped in only after swapping the previous one out.
 *
 * Replaces the deprecated [[Hotswap]] with a safer API.

   * Allocates a new resource and closes the previous one.
   *
   * When the lifetime of the [[Hotswap2]] is completed, the resource allocated by the most

   * [[swap]] finalizes the previous resource immediately, so users must ensure that the old `R`
   * is not used thereafter. Failure to do so may result in an error on the _consumer_ side. In
   * any case, no resources will be leaked.
   *
   * To access the current resource, use [[get]], which guarantees that it will not be released
   * while it is being used.
   *
   * If [[swap]] is called after the lifetime of the [[Hotswap2]] is over, it will raise an
   * error, but will ensure that all resources are finalized before returning.
