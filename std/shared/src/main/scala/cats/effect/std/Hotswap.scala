/**
 * A concurrent data structure that exposes a linear sequence of `R` resources as a single
 * [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] in `F` without accumulation.
 *
 * A [[Hotswap]] is allocated within a [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource]] that dictates the scope
 * of its lifetime. After creation, a `Resource[F, R]` can be swapped in by calling [[swap]].
 * The newly acquired resource is returned and is released either when the [[Hotswap]] is
 * finalized or upon the next call to [[swap]], whichever occurs first.
 *
 * The following diagram illustrates the linear allocation and release of three resources `r1`,
 * `r2`, and `r3` cycled through [[Hotswap]]:
 *
 * {{{
 * >----- swap(r1) ---- swap(r2) ---- swap(r3) ----X
 * |        |             |             |          |
 * Creation |             |             |          |
 *         r1 acquired    |             |          |
 *                       r2 acquired    |          |
 *                       r1 released   r3 acquired |
 *                                     r2 released |
 *                                                 r3 released
 * }}}
 *
 * [[Hotswap]] is particularly useful when working with effects that cycle through resources,
 * like writing bytes to files or rotating files every N bytes or M seconds. Without
 * [[Hotswap]], such effects leak resources: on each file rotation, a file handle or some
 * internal resource handle accumulates. With [[Hotswap]], the only registered resource is the
 * [[Hotswap]] itself, and each file is swapped in only after swapping the previous one out.
